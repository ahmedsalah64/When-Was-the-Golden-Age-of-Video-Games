# When-Was-the-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games
In this project, I will analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I will search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I will explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

my search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I will also filter, group, and order data.
